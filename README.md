## Project Briefly Introduction
This project is using data visualization technique to illustrate sentiment analysis result on Twitter data about 2016 president campaign.

#### Homepage

In our homepage. we show the final result of the campaign on the map. the states which support Trump are in red color, and the blue color states are for Hillary. The points on the map are specific Twitters. The pink points are twitters obtaining positive attitude for Hillary, and the brown points spoke highly of Trump. If you put your mouse on any state or point, you can see the detail information. On the right side of the webpage, we use donut chart to show our result of sentiment analysis. For the Twitters mentioned Trump, there were 80 percent positive support. While for Hillaryâ€™s, she only got 53 percent. #### Analysis Page
In the second page, we visualize tweet sentiments in detail. First look at the top two charts. on the left the red chart is every second the average sentiment scores about trump and right the blue chart is about Hillary. The sentiments score, the y axis, is from -1 to 1. The higher score means more positive feelings. we also use the brush to control the time to select the time period and zoom in to see the details.
Below are also sentiment charts. The only difference is it calculates the average sentiments around 20 minutes. And these are the word clouds during these time. They can be controlled together by a time slide. So we can see the trend from the beginning to the end during election night.
On the bottom is sentiments about some topics like race, economy. Y axis counts the tweets. Negative feelings are in blue. The more neutral the feeling is, the smaller and lighter bubble will be.

#### Popular Words Page
In the third page, we have bubble cloud chat to show the top 20 words of the tweets. The size of the bubble is based on the number of words. You can choose from a drop down of time periods to see the popular words.
